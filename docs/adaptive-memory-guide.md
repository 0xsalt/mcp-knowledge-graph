# Adaptive Memory Management Guide

## Context-Aware Memory Triggers

This guide provides universal memory management principles that adapt to any project context and development stage.

### Core Principle: Lean Knowledge Graph

**Golden Rule**: Add entities only when they have **2+ meaningful relationships** OR **3+ important observations** to prevent information overload and maintain actionable insights.

### Universal Memory Categories

#### 0. **Knowledge Base**
*Domain expertise, standards, methodologies, frameworks*

#### 1. **Environmental Context** 
*External factors, constraints, market conditions, regulations*

#### 2. **Solution Architecture**
*Implementation details, technical decisions, design patterns*

#### 3. **Network Mapping**
*People, organizations, stakeholders, collaborators*

#### 4. **Progress Tracking**
*Milestones, performance metrics, feedback, results*

#### 5. **Strategic Context**
*Objectives, constraints, risks, high-level decisions*

### Entity Addition Criteria

**Significance Threshold**: 
- **2+ meaningful relationships** with existing entities, OR
- **3+ important observations** that provide actionable insights

**Focus Areas**:
- Persistent, high-value information over ephemeral details
- Actionable insights over comprehensive documentation  
- Relationship patterns that reveal important connections

### Integration Instructions

To implement this guide in your project:

1. **Add to Project CLAUDE.md**: Copy the Core Principle and Entity Addition Criteria to your development rules
2. **Customize Categories**: Adapt the 6 universal categories to your domain language and context
3. **Set Context**: Define what constitutes "meaningful relationships" and "important observations" for your specific project

### Adaptive Usage

The categories automatically adapt based on project type:
- **Software Projects**: Knowledge Base = technical standards, Environmental Context = user requirements
- **Research Projects**: Knowledge Base = literature review, Environmental Context = funding constraints  
- **Creative Projects**: Knowledge Base = design principles, Environmental Context = audience preferences

This lean approach ensures your knowledge graph grows organically while maintaining focus on high-value, actionable information regardless of project domain.
